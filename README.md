## Why this project built?

This is an open source project aim to help you find the neareast toilet. 

Imagine someday you are about to shit in your pants, but you have no idea where to go!  And you start to search on your map "where is the nearest public toilet?" "oh noðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜« There is no public toilet AT ALL!!" "where is the closest McDonald's??" "Ah! Found it". And you walk 10 minutes to get there. But what you don't know is there is a nearer place you can go to release your stomach JUST BESIDES YOU!!!  And this project is to help you avoid this situation.

## How to use this app?

Starting with this project on your smartphone, just hit `PANIC!` button. It'll show you the nearest bathroom and guide you there automatically.

WHAAAAAT? You dont like that place? That's fine! You can also click other place with `Toliet Signs`  and by clicking `navigate to that place`  you'll also get directions to that place you just clicked.

Remember turn on your `location feature`  and give this app permission to access your current location.

## TODO

- [ ] Add some filters so users can choose their preferred locations (like if you don't want to use a toilet in a Walmart, you can filter that out)
- [x]  Add a list view for a more intuitive display of places
- [ ]  Users can add toilets to the list
- [ ] Still brainstorming...
